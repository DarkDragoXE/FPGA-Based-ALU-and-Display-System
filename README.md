# FPGA-Based-ALU-and-Display-System
FPGA-based ALU on Basys-3 (Artix-7) built in synthesizable Verilog. Integrates 4-bit add/multiply with 4-digit 7-segment display, a 3-tap FIR filter [1,2,1], a 4-bit safe-code comparator, and a BCD-to-7-seg driver. Modules were designed, simulated, and integrated in Vivado 2023.1, demonstrating combinational + sequential digital design on hardware.
